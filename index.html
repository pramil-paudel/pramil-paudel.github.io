            <h2>I am Pramil Paudel, PhD student in Computer Science </h2>
             <h3>University of Kansas, Lawrence Kansas</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my git hub page. I am lazy as hell and believe me there is nothing in the github you can learn about me. I hate HTML and you might wonder how I call myself a software engineer who doesn't have an energy even to write about myself. People usually call me developer for logics and solutions. I worked for more than 5 years in different software companies. I worked as software developer mainly for Java based application. If you ask me what framework I know in details, I might answer you I don't know anything but I bet I can work in your organization in any role you want to give me. I can architect small to large web applications from scratch. If you hire me in your company make sure you have plenty of resources who can work in my ideas. I am person of trust and orthodox solutions. My solutions may be completely different than you expect but fasten your belt, I can rise your organization completely to new height. I love to work in Backend, devops and organizational management. </p>
